# RoboticsKinematicsMath
This repository is based on concepts from Peter Corke's robotics lectures and implements them in Python. It covers 2D and 3D geometry, forward and inverse kinematics, and velocity kinematics, focusing on transformations, poses, and motion to help understand the math behind robotics.
